**Key Features:**
* Supports multiple languages
* Make Unlimited Custom Food Items
* Decide how much food/water the food item gives the player
* Choose what prop will be shown in the players hand when they eat the food or drink the drink
* Progress Bar Will show the food/drink items label when consuming without you having to add it in config for example if the food items label is "Cheese Burger" then while eating the progress Bar will have a description that says "Eating Cheese Burger..." etc. 

**How Does It Work?:**

Its Easy, You create an item that you want to be a food or drink item. Then add your item in the config file. You choose how much food or drink it gives the player when the player eats or drinks the food item. As well as the prop that will be shown in the players hand when they eat it.
